<h4>Backbone.Stage</h4>
<p>In a Backbone+ application there is one special extended scene that represents the stage.  The stage will help with the task of managing your application's viewport properties and current scene.</p>

<h4>Creating a Backbone.Stage</h4>
<p>Most likely you will want to create your stage after DOM ready has fired.  Also, you will want to attach a new router instance to the stage.  This way the stage can help with scene changes.</p>
<pre>
// App Ready
$(document).ready(function() {
	App = new Backbone.Stage();
	App.router = new AppRouter();
});
</pre>
